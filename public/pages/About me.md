# About me

Hi, I'm Simone, a computer science student.
I entered the world of programming during highschool starting with C, then moving to Java, and then discovering web programming with PHP and JavaScript. Go and Kotlin followed, with also different frameworks and programming paradigms.

I'm now starting my master degree at the University of Trento and I'm always keeping an eye on
all the hackathons and tech events that are organized nearby.

This website was published on september 2019 and is still quite empty, but I plan to publish some of my projects and programming related experiences.
