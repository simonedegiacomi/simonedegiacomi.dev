# About me

Hi, I'm Simone, a computer science student.
I entered the world of programming during highschool starting with C, moved to Java, and then discovered web programming
with PHP and JavaScript. Go and Kotlin followed, with also different frameworks and programming paradigms.

I'm now starting my master degree at the University of Trento and I'm always keeping an eye on
all the hackathons that are organized nearby.

This website is still quite empty, but I plan to publish some of my projects and programming related experiences.
