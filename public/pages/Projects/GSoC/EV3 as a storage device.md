Introduction

OpenRoberta is a learning platform that uses a graphical programming language to program different robots. One of the robots supported by OpenRoberta is the Lego EV3, and it supports it in two main ways which both require a custom firmware. The problem with this approach is that the process of running a program include many steps and takes a lot of time. A simpler approach is needed, since a faster solution could increase the usage of OpenRoberta with EV3, especially in competitions.
Project goal

The goal of my project is to enable OpenRoberta to generate UF2 files, which will then be downloaded by the user and copied over the EV3 running the stock firmware. The user will then be able to start the program as if it were a program created with the official Lego Mindstorm IDE.
