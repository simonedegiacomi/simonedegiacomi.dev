# Olivetti Cash Register 2019 - EIT Digital with Ultrahack

## Challenge

The challenge consisted in developing an application for the new Olivetti Cash Register (which runs Android) to help merchants to digitize their stores. The area to digitize could be anything from  customer relations, methods of payments, warehouse, taxation or shop assisting systems. 
Throughout the 48 hrs of hackathon we had available two types of mentors: technical mentors, who knew how the cash register works in details, and marketing mentors, to help us to validate our ideas.

## Our idea

Our idea consisted in a system that would allow merchants to generate an e-commerce website from her/his new Olivetti Cash Register. Downloading the Olivetti Social Manager App from the Olivetti Store, the merchant would be able to express the style and the story of his/her shop through a website easily accessible from every device.

Products would be automatically imported from the Cash Register using the Olivetti APIs (provided from one of the default applications).

When it's time to publish a new offer, the merchant would select the product, insert a message and publish the offer on multiple social channel in a single shot: Facebook posts, Instagram photos or push notification for the users that already have opened the webapp on their phone. Moreover, the platform would allow the merchant to publish Ads using Facebook Ads, Instagram Ads and similar services.

## What we implemented

We implemented different small parts of the idea, to be able to show the most important features during the presentation.

Implemented components:
- Prototype interface of the app running on the Cash Register. The app is built using Flutter.
- Prototype interface of the e-commerce running on the smartphone of the customer. The app is built using React.js.
- Facebook bot server implemented with Express. The bot uses Microsoft LUIS to extract intents from the user messages.
- Microsoft LUIS training for customers common questions.
