## Results

Unfortunately, we didn't win any of the threee challenges

## My thoughts about what went wrong

I think that there could be two problems: the idea or the implementation.
For the implementation side I think that we only built an high cost prototype. The end result wouldn't have been different
if we stopped at the Adobe XD mock, since we put only videos of the app usage in the website. 
We then could have much more time to implement a POC that actually would have matter.
And this takes us to the second problem: the idea is not that different from the already existing app. The only difference
woul been that the trips were generated automatically. 
Maybe we could have used just the mock but write the algorithm to use the existing data.
